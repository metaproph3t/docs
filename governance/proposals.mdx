description: "What proposals can do and how they go live"

Anyone can create a proposal to a project. Proposals can:
- Spend USDC from the treasury
- Issue new tokens
- Update token metadata
- Increase or decrease the liquidity provided by the project's treasury

Once a proposal is created, holders must stake tokens on it for it to
go live. By default, a proposal requires 50,000 tokens (5% of the ICO)
staked on it for it to go live.

Staking is purely to prevent spam and doesn't have lockups or risk of slashing.

There can only be one proposal live at once.
