title: "How it Works"
---

You can read the other sections for a detailed description, but high-level:
- Raises happen through ICOs where the funds go to an onchain treasury instead of to the team
- The team can spend a monthly budget without approval, but they need governance approval
for bigger spends or new token issuance
- All of the project's IP is held in a legal entity that enshrines governance as the arbiter
- Governance is via markets, not voting
