MetaDAO is for:
- Long-term founders who wants to build a crypto-native enterprise
- Active crypto investors who want to avoid being systematically looted by grifters

There are two differences between MetaDAO and a typical fundraising platform.

The first is that when a project raises money, it doesn't go directly to the team.
It goes to an on-chain treasury with governance oversight.

The second is that every project has a legal entity that owns that project's IP
that is controlled by governance. Project revenue cannot be siphoned off by a separate
team-controlled entity - it must go the project's treasury.
