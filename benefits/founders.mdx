### A community of believers on day 1

The biggest advantage of doing an ICO is that you get an organic and aligned community of believers on day 1.

### A valuable token

It benefits you as a founder when the market recognizes your token as valuable. It allows you to raise more, to make acquisitions, and to provide competitive offers for roles.

You can ask yourself: “all else being equal, would I rather hold a token with these protections or without these protections?”

### Higher-quality holders

Whether the token has intrinsic value matters much more to long-term holders than to token flippers.

So launching with real value embedded in your token means that you are able to attract a more longer-term oriented and more thoughtful holder base than you otherwise would.

### A mintable token means you won’t run out of supply

Imagine if Facebook couldn’t acquire Instagram or Google couldn’t acquire YouTube because they had “run out of supply.”

### Instill confidence in your community

Occasionally, someone on crypto twitter will claim that a project founder has “OTCed” (i.e. sold) their tokens. But because everything is so opaque and backroom deals are so endemic, it’s hard to tell who is lying and who is telling the truth.

It’s not that these debates are meaningless drama either - whether a founder has cashed out can have a meaningful effect on their motivation level.

With MetaDAO, all token allocations are totally transparent and on-chain. So backroom deals are less likely to be common and false claims will be easier to dispel.

### You maintain day-to-day control

The term “DAO” has historically been synonymous with drama and gridlock. So it’s natural to feel scared of giving up control to a Futarchy DAO.

But the reality is that there are only two types of decisions that need to go to futarchy today - big spends and token allocations. The founders have discretion to make all day-to-day decisions.

Think of the futarchy as a board of directors - you can still operate your business with relative autonomy but you need big decisions to get checked by the futarchy.

### Going public early = entering the arena

According to Silicon Valley investor Bill Gurley, Mark Zuckerberg regrets not going public earlier because of the discipline it enforces on the founder.

For better or for worse, launching a token is “entering the arena.” You will have stakeholders, what you do will be more public than it otherwise would be, and there will be a feedback loop between what you say and do and the price of your token. This is beneficial for a certain type of founder.

### Comparatively graceful wind-downs

Sometimes, things don’t work out. This is accepted as a basic fact of venture investing: many investments will go to 0, to be paid for by the ones that ‘return the fund.’

But today, a token can follow you forever. People can call you a “rugger” if you abandon the project.

MetaDAO provides a very clear social contract around projects - if the project decides to wind down (via a futarchy proposal that liquidates all assets and distributes whatever’s left to tokenholders), that is fair game and the founder has no obligation to work on the project after that.

### The MetaDAO community will be your early supporters

Today, there is a reasonably sized (50 - 500 people) cohort of people that are excited about futarchy and MetaDAO’s approach to internet capital markets. These include some of the sharpest minds on Solana and in crypto.

Launching on MetaDAO gives you the possibility of financially aligning these people.
