## Overview

MetaDAO helps token investors in two ways:
- Mechanistic protection against treasury rugs
- Legal protection against revenue rugs

## Mechanistic protection against treasury rugs

On Solana in 2021 there were four big ICOs:
- **Parrot:** raised \$85M, [the team walked away with \$72M of it](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/21/defi-project-parrot-puts-fate-of-over-70m-treasury-prt-token-to-vote)
- **UXD:** raised \$57M, [insiders walked away with \$46M of it](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VYv7qHD9kpfFeY_nBjT6jkqbA0HHf4w5gBVFRuN5OPU/edit?gid=1572994615#gid=1572994615)
- **Mango:** raised \$70M, [the founders are suing each other for stealing from the project](https://x.com/dj_d_sol/status/1843666330429600216)
- **Aurory:** raised \$108M, [the token is down 99.5% and it's unclear where the money has gone](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aurory/)

On MetaDAO, all of the funds go to a market-governed treasury.

If a nefarious actor walks away from the project, or if the price drips below book value, anyone can raise a proposal
to return capital to tokenholders. 

## Legal protection against revenue rugs

Famously, the [\$30m](https://dune.com/Marcov/uniswap-revenue) Uniswap has made from its frontend is retained solely by Uniswap Labs and will likely never end up in the hands of tokenholders.

Less famously, the Unibot team built Trojan, which made [\$206M in fees](https://defillama.com/protocol/fees/trojan), and decided to keep the revenue for themselves rather than integrating the \$UNIBOT token.

Because of the legal entity created at launch, tokenholders could sue teams that misappropriate the projectâ€™s revenues or compel service providers (domain name registrars, social media companies, etc.) to transfer control of IP to a new team.
