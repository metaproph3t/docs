### Mechanistic protection against treasury rugs

As mentioned in “The stnadard ways → ICOs,” it’s been fairly common for nefarious crypto teams to outright walk away with the money raised from an ICO.

On MetaDAO, this is much harder.

For example, if a nefarious actor raised \$1m with the monthly burn set to \$50k and disappeared, they would be able to walk away with \$50k but the investors would be able to liquidate and recover 95% of their capital.

### Legal protection against revenue rugs

Famously, the [\$30m](https://dune.com/Marcov/uniswap-revenue) Uniswap has made from its frontend is retained solely by Uniswap Labs and will likely never end up in the hands of tokenholders.

Less famously, the Unibot team built Trojan, which made \$206M in fees, and decided to keep the revenue for themselves rather than integrating the \$UNIBOT token.

Because of the legal entity created at launch, tokenholders could sue teams that misappropriate the project’s revenues or compel service providers (domain name registrars, social media companies, etc.) to transfer control of IP to a new team.
