title: "The ICO"
---

The founder can decide to initiate the ICO at any point.

Then, anyone can contribute USDC over 4 days. Everyone gets
the same price.

If the ICO doesn't reach its minimum viable funding, everyone
is refunded.

If it does, the founder can decide how much of the USDC they want
the project to keep. For example, a project with a minimum viable
funding of \$300k could end up raising \$1m and the founder could
decide that they only want \$500k.

10M tokens are then sent out proportionally to everyone who
participated in the ICO. Partial refunds are also sent out,
so in the above example someone who had contributed \$1000 would
get \$500 back.

20% of the raised funds are then paired with 2M tokens in a liquidity
pool, allowing people to buy and sell tokens on Jupiter.
