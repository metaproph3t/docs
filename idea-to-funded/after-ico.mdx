title: "After the ICO"

All of the money raised and the LP position go to an on-chain treasury
managed by futarchy.

This treasury is technically a 1/1 multisig on Squads where the signer is
the Futarchy DAO, which allows anyone to see its assets on Squads' interface:

The team can pull out the monthly burn rate they configured at ICO time
without needing any DAO proposals. You need proposals to change this 
burn rate, make big spends, or issue new tokens.
