## What we need

Before an ICO, the founder must provide details like project name, description,
intended ticker name, **minimum viable funding**, and **price-based premine %** to MetaDAO.

Minimum viable funding is the minimum amount of USDC a founder would need to
work on their project. If the ICO fails to reach it, everyone will be refunded.

Founders can choose to allocate up to 50% of the initial supply to a team premine
that unlocks if they hit certain price milestones. (TODO: add more details here)

Additionally, **founders must sign an agreement that transfers the IP of the project
like its domain names and social media accounts to a newly-created legal entity.**
They'll get this back if the ICO fails to reach its minimum. Founders can be
pseudonymous.

## The approval process

Once you provide this information on MetaDAO's website and sign the agreement on
MetaLeX's website, it goes to internal review.

Assuming your description is well-formatted (e.g. doesn't have typos, is logically
coherent), the MetaDAO team should approve it within 24 hours. This will make it
visible on the site.
