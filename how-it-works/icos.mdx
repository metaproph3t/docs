### Before the ICO

Before an ICO, the founder must provide details like project name, description,
intended ticker name, **minimum viable funding**, and **price-based premine %** to MetaDAO.

Minimum viable funding is the minimum amount of USDC a founder would need to
work on their project. If the ICO fails to reach it, everyone will be refunded.

Founders can choose to allocate up to 50% of the initial supply to a team premine
that unlocks if they hit certain price milestones.

Additionally, **founders must sign an agreement that transfers the IP of the project
like its domain names and social media accounts to a newly-created legal entity.**
They'll get this back if the ICO fails to reach its minimum. Founders can be
pseudonymous.

### The ICO

The founder can decide to initiate the ICO at any point.

Then, anyone can contribute USDC over 4 days. Everyone gets
the same price.

If the ICO doesn't reach its minimum viable funding, everyone
is refunded.

If it does, the founder can decide how much of the USDC they want
the project to keep. For example, a project with a minimum viable
funding of \$300k could end up raising \$1m and the founder could
decide that they only want \$500k.

10M tokens are then sent out proportionally to everyone who
participated in the ICO. Partial refunds are also sent out,
so in the above example someone who had contributed \$1000 would
get \$500 back.

20% of the raised funds are then paired with 2M tokens in a liquidity
pool, allowing people to buy and sell tokens on Jupiter.



### After the ICO

The first step of any ICO is founders providing the following details to MetaDAO:
- Project name (e.g. "Omnipair")
- One-line d
- Project description (e.g. "Omnipair is a new )



Projects go through the following steps on MetaDAO:

- Founders provide details including project name, description, intended ticker name, anticipated burn rate, and **minimum viable funding.**
- Founders transfer ownership of the IP - domain names, software, social media accounts, etc. - to a newly-created legal entity.
- The founder kicks off the ICO, and anyone can contribute USDC over 4 days. There’s no cap.
- If the ICO doesn’t reach its minimum viable funding, everyone is refunded their USDC.
- If it does:
  - 10M tokens are distributed proportionally among all the participants of the ICO.
  - The funds are moved to a Squads smart account. This smart account lets the founder spend their burn rate every month. Beyond that, or to mint more tokens, they must raise proposals to a newly-created Futarchy DAO. This DAO also has the ability to control the legal entity.
  - 2M tokens and 20% of the raised USDC are provided to a liquidity pool.

Today, founders must raise proposals to the DAO to get a team allocation.
