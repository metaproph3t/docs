Projects go through the following steps on MetaDAO:

- Founders provide details including project name, description, intended ticker name, anticipated burn rate, and **minimum viable funding.**
- Founders transfer ownership of the IP - domain names, software, social media accounts, etc. - to a newly-created legal entity.
- The founder kicks off the ICO, and anyone can contribute USDC over 4 days. There’s no cap.
- If the ICO doesn’t reach its minimum viable funding, everyone is refunded their USDC.
- If it does:
  - 10M tokens are distributed proportionally among all the participants of the ICO.
  - The funds are moved to a Squads smart account. This smart account lets the founder spend their burn rate every month. Beyond that, or to mint more tokens, they must raise proposals to a newly-created Futarchy DAO. This DAO also has the ability to control the legal entity.
  - 2M tokens and 20% of the raised USDC are provided to a liquidity pool.

Today, founders must raise proposals to the DAO to get a team allocation.
