But with great opportunity comes great risk. And tokens are no exception - many of the standard ways of launching tokens don’t work. Here, we cover the most notable.

### Low float / high FDV

The standard way to build a crypto project is to do the following:

- Sell 10 - 25% of the token supply to angels and VCs
- Build a product
- Get usage, mostly from airdrop farmers
- Build hype going into your token launch day (’TGE’)
- Allocate some more of the supply to CEXes so that they list you
- Airdrop 10% of the supply
- Vest the team and investors over 2-4 years

This is a fine way to extract money from retail but it’s not purpose-built for building real businesses or aligning communities.

Front-loaded demand (from your TGE hype) and back-loaded supply (the vest) means that prices generally collapse over time. And when this happens, “the community” who bought on TGE date starts feeling less like a community and more like an angry mob.

Platforms like Echo and Legion improve this by allowing regular people to participate in those early funding rounds but they don’t change the structure of this system.

### ICOs

Some projects have instead raised the money to build their product with an ICO. Ethereum is a notable example of this.

Unfortunately, most ICOs rugged. For example, in 2021 on Solana there were four ICOs that raised more than \$50m: Parrot (\$96m), UXD (\$66m), Mango (\$80m), and Aurory (\$102m). The Parrot team walked off with \$72m, the UXD team walked off with \$22m, the Mango founders are suing each other for stealing money, and Aurory is trading 99% below its ICO price.

This has led to most investors, especially serious ones, being wary of ICOs.

### Bonding curves

Though not many serious projects have used bonding curves like those on Pump, Believe, and Heaven, a few have.

Bonding curves are ill-suited for serious enterprises because:

1. They don’t bring much cash into the project. Even if the team gets trading fees, as they do on Believe and Heaven, these are often only a small percentage of what the project could have raised.
2. They allow for sniping. A founding engineer may be reluctant to spend 4 years working for 1% when someone was able to buy 1% of the supply on a bonding curve for \$150.
