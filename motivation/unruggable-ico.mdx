title: "Unruggable ICOs"
---

To better align teams and communities, MetaDAO introduces a
new concept: **the Unruggable ICO.**

### What's an Unruggable ICO?

Unruggable ICOs are like normal ICOs except:

1. The money raised doesn't go directly to the team. Instead, it's kept
   in a treasury with oversight by a market-based governance mechanism:
   **futarchy**.
2. The founder assigns the IP of the project to a legal entity that is
   controlled by futarchy.

### Why do they matter?

Simply put, **Unruggable ICOs decrease the risk that the team will
walk off with investors' money.**

This enables founders to raise more and from higher-quality investors
than they otherwise would be able to.

### Unruggable ICOs are still early and risky

To help manage some of the risk associated with novel approaches to
governance and legal ownership, **MetaDAO is pre-credible neutrality**.

The MetaDAO team has a backdoor that could in theory be used to 
halt, reject, or pass arbitrary proposals.

Teams and investors should not be reliant on this backdoor to reject
proposals they don't like, which means that **you should understand
futarchy and our approach to IP before launching a project on MetaDAO
or investing in projects that use MetaDAO.**
