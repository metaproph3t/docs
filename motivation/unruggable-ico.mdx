MetaDAO introduces a new concept: the Unruggable ICO.

Unruggable ICOs are like normal ICOs except for two differences:

1. Instead of the funds going directly to the team theyâ€™re stored in an onchain treasury with oversight by a market-based governance mechanism called futarchy.
2. The founder assigns the intellectual property of the project (domain names, software, etc.) to a legal entity that recognizes the aforementioned governance mechanism as the ultimate decider.

The former prevents teams from rugging the funds from the treasury. The latter prevents teams from redirecting revenues from the project to themselves.
