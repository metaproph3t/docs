#### The future of capital markets is on the internet

A tokenized enterprise can:

- Convert its early customers and believers into owners
- Incentivize early adoption and bootstrap network effects
- Offer liquidity earlier than the 7-10 years common in Silicon Valley

#### But tokens are broken today

But founders and investors are poorly served by the existing token
landscape.

Low float / high FDV, bonding curves, and ICOs all have serious
structural problems.

#### MetaDAO makes tokens work with Unruggable ICOs

Imagine you could invest money in projects without being
worried about whether the founder will take your money and
run. 

Imagine you could prove to your community that you won't take
their money and run, thus enabling you to raise more and from
higher-quality people.
