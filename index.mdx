## Community ownership matters

Projects grow faster when they have an army of bagholders supporting them.

[//]: # (TODO: add links on stablecoin market cap to DeFillama and developer count on electric report and faster and cheaper)

Consider the following:
- Ethereum did an ICO for 85% of its supply. It remains dominant on stablecoin market cap and
developer count despite Solana being 10x faster and 1000x cheaper.
- Hyperliquid distributed 33% of its supply to its users. Its perp volume 6xed.
- MegaETH sold tokens in an Echo round to 2,900 people. Its Kaito mindshare 15xed.

## But most tokens today are done poorly

We believe that tokens are broken. You can watch Felipe Montealgre's talk for a full
explanation as to why, but the TL;DR is
- Low float / high FDV tokens get dumped
- ICOs and presales get rugged
- Memecoins, including those that purport to be "ICM coins," get traded, not held

## MetaDAO is for entrepreneurs who want to launch a token the right way

We built a new system for creating onchain enterprises, built from the ground up
with high-quality investors and founders in mind. 

This system's core principles are:
- **ICO on day 1:** the two biggest crypto projects (Bitcoin and Ethereum) launched their tokens very early on in their life cycle. You can, too. And ICOs are a reasonable way to do so.
- **Ownership and unruggability:** the token is a first-class citizen of any project launched on MetaDAO. Practically, that means two things: (1) funds raised are held in a market-governed treasury (2) IP is held in a legal entity governed by the same mechanism.
- **Pay-for-performance:** insiders should only unlock tokens when the token has hit price milestones. By default, insiders receive 20% of their allocation on every doubling over the ICO price - for example, insiders would vest 40% of their allocation once the project has grown 4x.
